                    <p>we understand that working for the environment is everyone’s responsibility. Our
                    community and environment have done so much for us and it’s now our turn to return the favour. our team conducts
                    tree plantation drives twice a year. To promote biodiversity, over 7 million saplings were planted during FY 2019-20.
                    The event saw an enthusiastic participation of 20,000+ people from over 150 villages across 12 states. If you or
                    your company wants to do tree plantation we, can be your best companion. Doing these years
                    now, we're used to running plantation drives
                    and helping various NGOs make our city greener. Tree plantation is
                    not actually very complicated. It only requires an expert and knowledgeable team.</p>

                    <h3>recycle waste</h3>
                    <p>There are a host of good reasons for recycling; While the central reason that it’s great for the environment is, of
                        course, perfectly valid, there are plenty of specific reasons too. Recycling reduces global warming and prevents
                        unnecessary greenhouse gasses reaching the atmosphere. Recycling (and up / downcycling) is good for wildlife. New
                        raw materials are generated from recycled products, providing a way to make new things without the further use of
                        resources that may be finite. we collect waste material in forest area and recycle it. We aims to enhance re-use of
                        construction and demolition waste. we know that we can’t do it alone. It’s going to take all the citizens of this
                        great country called India to come
                        together and be the change.</p>

                    <p>
                        we arrange programmes to create awareness on water conservation.
                        Water is a very precious resource which is the very source of life. It is said that if ever there will be a third
                        world
                        war, it would be fought for the control of water reserves. For some communities, however, water shortages have
                        become a
                        chronic reality of life. To help them mitigate this crisis, we have implemented a series of initiatives encapsulated
                        under our Project. The far-reaching program has converted more than 230 villages in the six states by augmenting
                        water availability and increasing ground water levels. The proactive measures include
                        construction of farm ponds, KT weir dams, sub-surface bunds, gabions, cordons and mini percolation tanks.

                        A Stand For Trees purchase provides the critical resources for the local communities to protect their forests. our
                        support directly improves the quality of life by providing employment through forest patrolling, training, and
                        sustainable farming. Your purchase also supports the distribution of
                        fuel-efficient cook-stoves, improving public health while reducing pressure on forest resources. 
                        Without support for the project, the area would likely be leased to foreign logging and mining companies, resulting
                        in
                        destruction of this critical habitat. This pioneering
                        project
                        demonstrates community resilience to help end deforestation while preventing climate change

                    <p>to provide lighting at night while consuming no electricity.
                        nowadays energy sources are limited and energy consumption has increased, So renewable energy sources are used to
                        meet
                        the increase in the demand for energy. Keeping this in mind in this project, we install a solar-powered LED
                        street light with auto intensity control. This project is driven by solar energy used to control the light intensity
                        from morning to evening based on the brightness. Because this solar-powered street light can conserve a large
                        amount of electricity compared to the other lights which are a light to their maximum intensity at all times after
                        they
                        are turned on Solar Powered Led Street Light with Auto Intensity Control Circuit and Its Working.
